# SshBatch
A simple program to read instructions from a batch file in the task to connect to a ssh server and a series 
of commands to run. The output will be displayed to the console and then it 
can be redirected to a log file.
This was done after fail attempts to use other ssh clients
(plink.exe -ssh host -m C:\path\commands.txt) ended up programming this using Renci Ssh Component.
